      When I was a child, I would always be day dreaming about
      the universe. I loved how the milkway looks, the colors, the stars, the planets. I even had
      a phase where I would wear galaxy leggings. This world is based off of one of my daydreams.
      I envisioned a fantasy world that features a woman in the center of the universe,
      her tears would be stars which would form the plannets around her.
      You may have noticed that the colors aren't very galaxy and milkyway-like.
      My color palette has changed since then so I decided to incorporate that as sort of a combination of
      my taste as a child versus now.
